## DECODING PULMONARY HEALTH THROUGH DEEP LEARNING TECHNIQUES
Accurate diagnosis of pulmonary conditions, including critical illnesses such as COVID-19, Bacterial Pneumonia, and Viral Pneumonia, is paramount for effective patient care. This project proposes a comprehensive methodology that harnesses advancements in deep learning techniques to facilitate the precise identification of various pulmonary diseases using chest X-ray images.

## About
<!--Detailed Description about the project-->
Pulmonary diseases pose significant challenges to public health worldwide, with conditions such as COVID-19, Bacterial Pneumonia, and Viral Pneumonia causing immense morbidity and mortality. Accurate and timely diagnosis is paramount for effective management and treatment of these conditions. However, traditional diagnostic methods often rely on subjective interpretation and can be time-consuming, leading to delays in patient care and treatment initiation. In recent years, advancements in medical imaging and deep learning have opened up new avenues for improving the accuracy and efficiency of pulmonary disease diagnosis.
